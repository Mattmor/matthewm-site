					<strong>My interest in A.I</strong>

				<div class="abouttext">
					I have always been fascinated by technology, especially cutting edge technology. This fascination has led me to my interest in space, the Internet and Artificial Intelligence.

                    The most interesting of the 3 to think about is Artificial Intelligence. Just imagining a world in which artificially made beings can think and communicate at a level of intelligence as humans excites the hell out of me.

                    Thus I have decided that I want to learn more about making code think. All of my A.I projects are on <a href="https://github.com/mattmorgan44">Github</a> if you wish to check them out. I also have a <a href="blog/">Blog</a> in which there will be some A.I related posts.
